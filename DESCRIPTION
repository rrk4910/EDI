Description: The effective drought index (EDI) is considered superior to several drought indices for drought assessment due to its ability to detect the initiation and termination of drought. In general, EDI quantifies drought through the concept of a surplus or deficit of water resources (Byun and Lee, 2002). The package computes the Effective Drought Index (EDI) (Byun and Wilhite, 1999) from a time series daily or monthly precipitation data.
